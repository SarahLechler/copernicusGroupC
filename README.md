Frontend of Copernicus Project at IFGI Muenster

## Welcome to the Copernicus Emergency Service specialized for flood relief managment!

The WebApp is a managing tool for flood relief workers which was implemented as part of the Copernicus StudyProject at the Institute for Geoinformatics at the University of MÃ¼nster. 
The purpose of the masters study project was getting familiar with the concepts as well as the technologies which are important for Copernicus.

The main challenges of the project were:

* Processing large amounts of data using Sentinel 1 images and in-situ data from PEGELONLINE and OpenWeatherMap
* Using of cloud services, in this case Amazon Web Service
* Developing a web application, which was created in particular as a big screen application for flood relief managers using Esri-Leaflet

The project was carried out for the region North Rhine-Westphalia, however it creates a framework which can be easily applied to other regions as well.

The WebApp allows the user to explore:
* most recent processed Sentinel 1 imagery and past Sentinel 1 displaying extracted waterbodies
* current and past water level of gauging stations 
* current and past data from weather stations 
* the current precipitation layer

The user can interact with the WebApp by:
* placing markers for workers and adding information about them for keeping track of where workers have been sent to
* placing markers for inaccessible roads in order to plan the fastest route to a working place
